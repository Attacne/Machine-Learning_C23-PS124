<h3 align="center">Acne Classification Mobile App </h3>

We build Machine Learning Model using Convolutional Neural Network to make acne classification into 6 classes (Blackhead, Whitehead, Papules, Pustules, and Healthy skin). The dataset we use is mostly from Roboflow and Dermnet with a total Image 1092 which are split into 772 training images and 260 validation images. We use transfer learning with MobileNet Architecture. The result of the model are gain 80% accuracy.
